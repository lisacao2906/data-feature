#Data Feature: A Data Visualization Tool 

This feature allows you to pick a metric related to children's welfare from the World Health Organization (think: mortality rate, nutrition, immunization,etc). Then, it displays the related stats of all countries on an interactive world map and a tableview. Moreover, you can zoom into the map or opt for the tableview for a more granular view.

## Functions
- Displays an interactive world map of any selected metric (about children's welfare) recorded by WHO.
- Displays a tableview of any selected metric (about children's welfare) recorded by WHO.

## Prerequisites
No prereq needed. 

## Usage
Ensure that you hit "Runall to be able to view the final output at the bottom of the notebook." 

## Note
In the ideal world, this feature would be a comprehensive dashboard of all world metrics, helping these philanthropic organizations in their decision-making when it comes to which country to provide support to. However, due to time constraints, this is a basic dashboard with limited number of metrics confined to children's welfare
