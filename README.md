This feature, in the form of a Jupyter notebook, displays Mortality Rate among children ages 10 to 14 years (per 1000 children aged 10) on a world map and a tableview. Moreover, you can zoom into the map or opt for the tableview for a more granular view.

## Functions
- Displays  an interactive world map of child mortality rate.
- Displays a tableview of world's child moratality rate.

## Prerequisites
No prereq needed. 

## Usage

## Note
In the ideal world, this feature would be a comprehensive dashboard of all children-related metrics, helping these philanthropic organizations in their decision-making when it comes to which country to provide support to. However, due to time constraints, this is a basic dashboard with 1 metric.
